# reliability
Desktop interface application on Python for my classmate's graduation project

Calculation of reliability factors and construction of scheme of an artillery system (in Russian)

First, we set the parameters of the artillery system and select the required components of the mechanism

After that, we get a summary of the results:
  - a topological scheme of movement
  - a list of elements of the scheme with their images
  - the reliability coefficient of this system

###### It was the first application of mine and the easiest thing for me was to make it in python
###### I used tkinter, turtle and PIL libraries


Example of work:
